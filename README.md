Codes to calculate crop calorie use 
Allocation of crops to Food and non-food uses, West et al

Here is an upload of all codes used to create results and figures for a paper being submitted to
Environmental Research: Food Systems

Codes are reasonably well commented at this initial commit, after revisions I'll come back and edit this

Some notes:
The codes in the 'datagateway' directoy all require public domain datasets to be downloaded and installed on users' 
computer.  I can't automate this because I don't want to republish others' data.  I'm available to help answer quesions
on how to do this (jgerber68@gmail.com)
